                    <p>
                        During my third semester, all students that enroll in course HPD229 need to execute a program called 'Mental Health Program' at UiTM Negeri Sembilan.
                         It was a wholesome and fun experience to be part of the activities since we got to share the ideas and knowledge together to ensure the program will 
                         run smoothly and successfully.

                    <h3>Motherboard scrapbook competition</h3>
                    <p>In my second semester, my group mates and I embarked on an exciting project called the "Motherboard Scrapbook". 
                        The concept behind this project was to create an interactive digital book that would not only educate users about the intricate components of a motherboard but 
                        also provide a fun and engaging learning experience. Our goal was to make learning about technology feel like flipping through a playful and informative scrapbook!
                        The Motherboard Scrapbook is a blend of learning and entertainment, designed to teach users about motherboard components, their functions, 
                        and the complex world of computer hardware.
