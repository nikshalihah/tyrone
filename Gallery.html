            We spent so many hours together during those high-pressure days, especially around the time of the SPM exams.
            Despite the stress and late-night study sessions, we always found ways to laugh, support each other, and make lasting memories.
            Those were the moments that helped me get through it all, and they remind me of how lucky I was to have such an amazing group of friends by my side. 
            Secondary school may be behind us now, but those memories still bring a smile to my face every time I think about them.</p>

              She‚Äôs a person who knows exactly what she wants in life and pursues it with unwavering determination. 
              Whether it‚Äôs chasing her dreams or completing every task with precision, she does it all with such focus and grace. 
              Throughout our time together, I‚Äôve always seen her as a natural leader and a guiding force around as well as
              someone who not only knows the way but also leads by example.

              Farah has this amazing ability to put everyone at ease, no matter what‚Äôs going on. 
              I absolutely love talking to her because her warmth and wholesome nature are contagious.

              She‚Äôs always there to remind me of the good things ahead and to comfort me whenever I‚Äôm feeling down. 
              In many ways, she‚Äôs like a sister to me ‚Äî always checking in on my day and making sure I‚Äôve eaten something (she worries if I don‚Äôt, haha!).

               I‚Äôve known her since Minggu Destini Siswa during our first semester, and I still remember the day we first met at Medan Selera UiTM Rembau. 
               It‚Äôs funny, because she knows almost every Korean song ‚Äî and I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs a huge fan of Korean culture!
